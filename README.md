## Contributing
Feel free to contribute in any way you like. You can't programm? You are still needed!

Please read and review the documentation. You can find it in the **doc-folder**.

#### Having questions?
Contact me at any time.

### How to get started
You need to have **[node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 8.9.0 or higher** installed. [More on node.js and npm.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) (npm.js comes with node.js). You can check your installed version with the command `node -v`.

To start open a terminal window (cmd or PowerShell on windows) in your working copy of this project. And run the command `npm install`. This will install all dependencies.

After that run `npm run build` to build the client side and make the viewer useable.

Then run `npm start` to start the server. Now you can use the viewer under http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

```
git clone https://github.com/Terreii/andromeda-viewer.git
cd andromeda-viewer
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

If you want to start developing you should run in a new terminal window `npm run watch`. It will build the viewer every time you make a change.

```
npm run watch
```

You can also only use `npm run startDev` to start the server and run the continuously build process!

For more information how to use npm, please read the [npm-documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/).

Everything needed for this project should be a npm dependency. So that all can be installed by running _npm install_
